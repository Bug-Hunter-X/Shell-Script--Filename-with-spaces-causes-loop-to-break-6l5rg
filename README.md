This repository demonstrates a common error in shell scripting involving the handling of filenames that contain spaces. The `bug.sh` script showcases the incorrect approach, while `bugSolution.sh` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from the way the shell expands unquoted variables in loops. When a variable contains spaces, the shell splits it into multiple words, resulting in unexpected behavior.
